If you need to run a version of Blender on Linux that isn't in your distribution repository, 
it can be cumbersome to run especially for rolling distributions where the system version of python can change. 
While Blenders website offers portable versions for Linux in a tarball, 
extracting these tarballs somewhere in your home directory 
where a directory hierarchy must be maintained is also less than ideal.

This repository contains two small bash scripts that download official Linux tarball releases of Blender LTS 
and converts it into an easy to use AppImage. 

Using an AppImage is as easy as extracting the zip somewhere and double-clicking it.
